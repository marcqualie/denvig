# Denvig Configuration


## Global Configuration

The file location for global configuration is `~/.denvig.yml`.

## codeRootDir

**default:** `~/src`

The root directory where your code lives. Development environment work best when there is a consistent location
for all projects. Denvig works on the concept of `[group]/[project]` so you can have a consistent structure
for all your projects. Since most people use GitHub, this maps to `[owner]/[repo]`.


## quickActions

**default:** build, dev, check-types, install, lint, outdated, test

A list of actions that will be available by default for all projects. See local configuration for more details.
